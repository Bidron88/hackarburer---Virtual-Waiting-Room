## The project

We decided to design a **virtual assistant for medical practitioners** which helps managing waiting time during a **tele consultation**. 
It is a **white-label web application** that will address all the stakeholders in the teleconsultation market while meeting the interoperability standards. 

<div style="display:flex; justify-content:space-around; margin:30px 0;">

</div>

The objectives are
* improve the user experience as the patient will be reassured and more inclined to stay connected. 
* boost the practitioner's productivity as his work will be refocused in only one interface.
* take advantage of the patient's waiting time to collect and qualify his personal and medical data in a highly secure way.
